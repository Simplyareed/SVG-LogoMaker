# SVG-LogoMaker

## Description

This project serves as a command-line tool that allows users, specifically freelance web developers, to quickly generate simple logos without the need for graphic design skills or software. The motivation behind this tool is to streamline the process of creating basic logos for projects, making branding simpler and more accessible.

 As a freelance web developer, I often found the need to create quick, simple logos for my web projects. Hiring a graphic designer for minor tasks proved costly and inefficient.
This tool addresses the need for quick, cost-effective logo creation without compromising on personalization.
It provides a swift solution for generating logos directly from the command line, offering customizable options like text, color, and shape.
Through developing this project, I've learned more about CLI development, user interaction in a console environment.
