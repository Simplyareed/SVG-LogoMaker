# SVG-LogoMaker

## Description

This project serves as a command-line tool that allows users, specifically freelance web developers, to quickly generate simple logos without the need for graphic design skills or software. The motivation behind this tool is to streamline the process of creating basic logos for projects, making branding simpler and more accessible.

 As a freelance web developer, I often found the need to create quick, simple logos for my web projects. Hiring a graphic designer for minor tasks proved costly and inefficient.
This tool addresses the need for quick, cost-effective logo creation without compromising on personalization.
It provides a swift solution for generating logos directly from the command line, offering customizable options like text, color, and shape.
Through developing this project, I've learned more about CLI development, user interaction in a console environment.

## Installation

Go into the terminal and run npm install, afterwards please refer to the usage section of the readme for futher details.

## Usage

After running npm install in the command line, you will be given a series of prompts to answer which will auto fill out your SVG logo that you wish to be created. 

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```


## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
